      <p>My primary goal in this year is to make new friends, get good grades, figure out how to make a game that I am proud of, and to make my parents proud.
       During my childhood, I had always loved playing games, I always loved playing it with my siblings. I wish to make a game that wil also inspire people to make
       games of their own one day. Finally, I want to improve myself in every way shape and form.</p>
